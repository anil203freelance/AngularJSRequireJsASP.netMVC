AngularJSRequireJsASP.netMVC
============================

Angular JS with Require Boilerplate sample using ASP.net MVC 

I ve developed a angular js based framework with require js.

I ve refered https://github.com/elsom25/angular-requirejs-html5boilerplate-seed
for understanding and used most of the code in my verion from here.

The aim is to provide the ready to use project structure which can be used with ASP.net MVC.

For the sake of simplicity I ve user MVC controller in place of Web API.

For database I ve used SQL server Compact Edition.

you can use the following credentials to test the code.
username: guest@ebs.in
password:qwe123

or you can signup using the signup form.

I am in the process of upgrading it.

Right now user can login, signup, Add/Edit acivity inline and add activity in a separate view too.

Bootstrap has been used for Design.
